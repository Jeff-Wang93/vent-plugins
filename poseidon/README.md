#  We are coding again. After a brief pause we are ready to extend Poseidon. Look for additional refinements to the machine learning, a simpler architecture, and better results. 

# Status
Currently the code is going through a simplification stage.  Many classes are being axed to get things to run in a single docker container.  The code at this point is not functional.

Situational awareness underpins informed decisions. Understanding what comprises a network, and what network elements are doing is essential.  Without situational awareness and context, defending a network remains a difficult proposition.

Can SDN and machine learning answer:
- What devices comprise my network?
- What are devices doing?

# Install Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/CyberReboot/poseidon.git
cd poseidon
*editor* config/poseidon.config
docker build -f ./Dockerfile -t poseidon .
docker run poseidon
```

# Configuration

## config/poseidon.config
### Monitor
- Under the `[Monitor]` section, update the following:
- `rabbit-server` to the external ip of the vent rabbit server
- `rabbit-port` to the port that the vent rabbit server is running

### NorthBoundControllerAbstraction:Update_Switch_State
- Under `[NorthBoundControllerAbstraction:Update_Switch_State]` section, update the following:
- `controller_uri` to the url for your controller
- `controller_user` username for logging into your controller
- `controller_pass` password for logging into your controller

### the following will be removed/moving around..
- `collection` to the name of the collection storing the network graph documents (default is `netgraph_beta`)
- `collector_nic` to the nic on the machine running vent that is configured with the controller to capture traffic
- `collector_interval` to the collection interval in seconds (default is `30` for a capture length of 30 seconds)
- `collector_filter` to limit what gets captured off the controller (default is empty string for no filters, see the collector documentation for details)
- `vent_ip` to the ip of the box running the vent collector
- `vent_port` to the external port of the nfilter vent container 
- `storage_interface_ip` to the external ip of the poseidon-storage-interface container (NOTE: this should be the same as the `database` field of `PoseidonStorage`, unlesss the storage-interface container is being run on a different machine)
- `storage_interface_port` to the external port of the poseidon-storage-interface container only if changed from the default of `28000`

# Required Dependencies
- Docker

# Documentation
- [Docs](https://github.com/CyberReboot/poseidon/tree/master/docs)

# Tests
Tests are currently written in py.test for Python.  The tests are automatically run when building the containers.
